              <h2>At SILFEN, sustainability means putting action behind the words, considering
                all stakeholders and always aiming a little bit higher when creating another
                collection. As a young, global fashion brand, it is our duty to take care of the
                planet, not only for own sake, but for all future generations to come.
                Since day one, we have launched various initiatives to keep our carbon footprint
                to an absolute minimum as well as making conscious decisions concerning the social
                impact on the communities in the countries, in which we operate.</h2>

              <h1>Goal 1: Less water spent on production</h1>
              <img src="img/goal1.png" alt="goal1">
              <p>The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries worldwide, and one of the
                biggest issues is the use and contamination of drinking water. We try to minimize the water
                consumption in our production in an effort to decrease its negative impact on the environment
                and to ensure local access to clean water.<br><br>All cotton used for production of SILFEN bags is
                either made from eco-friendly or organic cotton. This means that there is much less consumption
                of water throughout production and treatment of our cotton, than conventional cotton products.<br><br>
                In 2020 we will introduce a new collection of bags made from a new material; rPET or Recycled
                Polyethylene Terephthalate. This recycled material is primarily made from plastic waste collected
                from the oceans, or from recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over the world.</p>

              <p>At Team Silfen, we believe that we have many, wide-spanning obligations. It is not only
                the environment, we must care for, but also the people who build our products from scratch.
                We believe that it is our job to amplify a healthy and socially responsible conduct within our
                organization, including all our suppliers. We ensure the ethical development of future generations
                by guaranteeing that our suppliers do not support or make use of child labor. We encourage our 
                factories to ensure that all families have the possibility to put their children in school.<br><br>
                Team Silfen provides insurance to all our hard-working employees as well as their family. Our
                factories also grant pensions to all employees, providing them with financial stability after
                retirement.<br><br>We support the different religions of employees and protect their right to engage
                with rituals, prayers etc. at any time. We condemn discrimination, and make sure that the employees
                are protected from prejudice and injustice at the workplace.<br><br>
                We visit our manufacturers regularly to ensure that they follow the issued principles regarding
                working conditions, quality, pollution etc. This allows us to promise our customers that a SILFEN
                bag is always crafted in a responsible manner.<br><br>
                All our manufacturers are SA8000 certified.</p>

              <p>We are aware of the major impact that the shipping industry have on our planet.
                Because of this, we strive to choose environmental-friendly shipping options when
                applicable. We are in close contact with other brands in our aim to minimize shipping
                as much as possible – by joining forces.<br><br>
                We strive to ship as much as possible in bulk – mostly by sea or train. These are
                the most environmentally friendly modes of shipping, reducing polluting emissions.</p>

                  <p>Some of the SILFEN bags is made from Cotton – a fabric commonly known as
                    polluting. At SILFEN, our cotton is either made from eco-friendly or organic
                    cotton. Both materials require far less water consumption than conventional
                    cotton products. Every nylon product is made from eco-friendly material, meaning
                    that the journey from raw material to SILFEN bag impacts the environment as little
                    as possible.</p>

                <p>All leather goods are made from sustainable high-quality calf leather and
                    is a bi product of the food industry, meaning that every part of the animal
                    is utilized in various industries. We love colors and new trends, but we incorporate
                    consciousness and quality in our design processes to retain timelessness in all products.
                    All our components, zippers, thread, reinforcement, glue etc., are made from high-quality
                    raw materials. We encourage our customers to take good care of their bag, prolonging the
                    life of the product. By caring for your bag, you will be able to create more experiences
                    with it – an important factor in creating a more sustainable, mindful business.</p>

                    to this since then. We make sure that all non-leather material – e.g. our nylon,
                    lacquer – are all 100% vegan, promising that these products do not contain any parts

                <p>In 2020 we are expecting to launch a new collection manufactured in rPET, recycled polyethylene
                    terephthalate. The material is well known as it is made from water bottles across the world –
                    bottles that often end up discarded in oceans or nature. This recycled material is primarily
                    made from plastic waste collected from the oceans, or from recycled plastic bottles gathered
                    from all over the world. With this new collection, we aim to emphasize the impact of pollution
                    irresponsible wasting. We wish to pass this awareness to our customers, and to encourage them
                    to help clean our oceans!</p>
